This plugin is designed to add the functionality to save events as a custom
post type and also to sync the creation, update, and deletion (trashing) of
these events with a google calendar.  Then using other plugins that read
from a calendar, these events can be displayed.

===== SETUP =====

##### Google Calendar Synchronization #####

Before using this plugin, modify the file "google-calendar/config.php"
to synchronize the events created with the plugin and the events displayed
on a google calendar.

##### Custom Handling of Errors #####

In order for the Google Calendar API not to crash the plugin (e.g. when
trying to delete an event that has already been deleted), the plugin will
simply record the error using the write_log custom function. The function
is described in this url: 

http://www.stumiller.me/sending-output-to-the-wordpress-debug-log/

For sake of simplicity, add the following lines to "functions.php":

if (!function_exists('write_log')) {
	function write_log ( $log )  {
		if ( true === WP_DEBUG ) {
			if ( is_array( $log ) || is_object( $log ) ) {
				error_log( print_r( $log, true ) );
			} else {
				error_log( $log );
			}
		}
	}
}

===== ACTIVATION =====

##### Email Functionality #####

In order to send emails, the settings must be configured to choose the
source and destination email addresses.  Once I figure out how to do this,
I will update this section of the README to reflect the steps necessary.
